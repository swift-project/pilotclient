      Clarification:
      <ul>
        <li>all swift code written by the swift team is licensed as GPLv3</li>
        <li>The vatlib for the VATSIM network is closed source. It requires a NDA with VATSIM if you want to see that code</li>
        <li>In order to connect to VATSIM servers you need your own VATSIM client key. You have the following options:
            <ul>
              <li>you can build and run <i>swift</i> with your own FSD servers,</li>
              <li>or you can ask VATSIM for your own key,</li>
              <li>or you can join the swift team and participate - by that you will use our key.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Furthermore <i>swift</i> uses it own database for model matching (i.e. datastore model metadata, no model objects).
             We allow VATSIM users and smaller FSD server operators to use the Web Services for those cases.
             If you want to use <i>swift</i> on your network please ask us for permission to download from these web services, 
             or run your own server.
             All data in the <i>swift</i> database are property of the <i>swift</i> team.
         </li>
