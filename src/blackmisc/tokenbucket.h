     * \brief Token bucket algorithm
     * \details This class implements the token bucket algorithm. Tokens as arbitrary unit are added to the bucket at a defined rate.
     *   Token can be consumsed as long as there are enough available. This class can be used to throttle traffic and packet
     *   generation. Each time a packet needs to be generated and sent a token is consumed. If no token is available, consumption
     *   will fail the the packet cannot be sent.
